\section{Introduction}

\section{Features}

% A summary of the features of your final project. For the mandatory assignment, you should provide the maximum ADDER_WIDTH tolerated by your design and the number of cycles your design requires to complete a 512-bit addition. If you have completed any of the optional assignments, make sure to summarize them as well in this part.

\section{Technical description}

% A technical description of your main arithmetic designs in the final project. For the improved combinational adder, you should explain the strategy you have followed and provide a high-level diagram of the design. The diagram should be similar to the ones seen in the lectures. For the optional features, you should also provide an explanation and, if required for comprehension, a high-level diagram.

\section{Performance evaluation}

% A performance evaluation of your arithmetic designs, including their worst-case delays (as detailed by Vivado in the post-synthesis report) and the area costs (as detailed by Vivado in the post-synthesis utilization report). 

The performance evaluation of our arithmetic design for an ADDER\_WIDTH of 128 bits consists of an evaluation of the worst-case delay and the area costs. We will firstly generate a post-synthesis Timing Summary to understand if the design met the timing constraints. This Timing Summary is visible on Figure \ref{fig:timing-128-bit}. We get a Worst Negative Slack (WNS) of 0.707 ns. Since this is a positive value, we can conclude that there are no timing errors during synthesis.
\\\\
The Intra-Clock Paths in the Timing Report allow us to form a conclusion about the worst case delay. Using the values from Figure \ref{fig:paths-128-bit}, we can calculate the worst-case delay as the sum of the logic and net delays of the worst path: 1.749 ns + 5.408 ns = 7.157 ns.
\\\\
To evaluate the area costs of our design, we take a look at the post-synthesis utilization report on Figure \ref{fig:utilization-128-bit}. We can see that there are 1608 LUTs and 3219 FFs.

\section{Comparison }

% A comparison of the obtained performance metrics with respect to the original ones from Lab #3, that is, when MP ADDER uses the ripple_carry_adder_Nb with ADDER_WIDTH = 16. Discuss whether the obtained results (speed improvement and area increases) are in line with the expectations.
